Things that do not work

- Cannot create docks with the new member functions, all the others work tho
- Error checking of ids in use when creating a new object, it always checks
against sailor ids, therefore I commented it out
- File save/load does not exist
- Merchants created by recruiting only have the id as 0
- A lot of the output is not the same as the sample output, especially kraken
