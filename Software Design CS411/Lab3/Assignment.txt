Modify your lab 2 assignment such that a right mouse click has the following actions on a point if it is clicked inside the point's bounding box:

A right click on a point changes its color to red if it is black.
A right click on a point deletes it if it is red.
A right click outside a bounding box for a point is IGNORED.

The point's bounding box is the rectangle formed to display the ellipse (circle) at that point. 
The change should be displayed immediately. 
If more than one point satisfies the criteria perform the appropriate action on all of them. This will be tested by the graders.

Do not output the coordinate as you did for lab 2. 
Do not include a clear button, but do include a menu with a clear item.

There must be only one ArrayList class instance. 
Create a new class that contains the coordinate of the point and its color. 
The color may be specified using any data type, e.g. 1=black, 2=red. A bool could also be used, true=red. 
Add new instances of this class to the ArrayList. You may also use the generic List class if you wish.

Hints - The foreach loop will not be adequate for this assignment.  
Study the ArrayList class in the help files for suitable methods, especially for deletion. 
The most common error is when two overlapping circles are added one after the other and a right clik is applied to the overlapping area, the action is not applied to both circles. TEST YOUR PROGRAM THOROUGHLY!
